# Code challenge

Hi,

you get a simple concept/design (in mobile layout). This is a list of people that you query via an API. Each person (tile) in the list has its own details page that you should route to for more details.

### About the listing page:
* There is a header with the Dept logo.
* Below this, 15 persons are displayed who are in a time zone between "- 1:00" and "+ 1:00" and are at least 18 years old.
    * The profile picture, title, first and last name are displayed.

### About the details page:
* There is a header with the Dept logo.
* The following should be displayed:
    * Profile picture
    * Title
    * First name
    * Last name
    * Date of birth
    * Place of residence
    * E-mail
    * Phone number
* There is an arrow for back navigation.


## Basics

* Vue should be used. Should you use any other framework, please let us know.
* The concept serves you only as a tool, you can implement it in exactly the same way, but you may also bring in your own style. Implement for mobile and desktop. Breakpoints are up to you.
* For the API you can use [https://randomuser.me/](https://randomuser.me/).
